-------> Project Description: 
Our app is called Travel Watcher . It's a budget tracker that helps you plan and keep better track of your expenses while you are traveling or on a trip. There are input fields for different types of expenses that you can add detials and cost to. You put in the desired budget you have and the expenses are subracted from that desired budget as you add them. Once you input your trip details you can hit the submit button which will save your information on a card. When you click on the MyTrips tab, your card and past trip cards will populate. You can edit them here as well or look back at them for reference for future trips. 

We added a user authentication feature so that you can login and view all of your trips
